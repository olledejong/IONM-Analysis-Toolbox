# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This application is constantly updated using electron-builder. Whenever  
a new version is deployed, old versions will force users to install the  
new version. This will be done by overwriting the previous version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you encounter or suspect any vulnerability, please contact me. I will  
try to deploy a patch as soon as possible.
