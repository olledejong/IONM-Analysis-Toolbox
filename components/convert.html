        <h3 class="content-h">Convert Eclipse CSV file(s) into a custom format</h3>
        <p class="content-p">
            This tool is a preprocess tool to eventually compute the statistics of the Eclipse files.
            It will convert Eclipse CSV files into multiple custom files: one separate file per modality.
            <br><br>
            All the modalities that the file, or files, contain should be already in the known modalities table. If not,
            the converting of the file that contains unknown modalities will fail. Don't worry, this is not a disaster! If
            this occurs, forms will appear where you can fill out the needed information. Since the names are given already
            it isn't that big of a deal to fill out the forms. After you're done, simply click the 'submit all' button to
            insert the new modalities into the modalities table. Since you came here to convert files, you can re-run the
            convert task for all the files that initially failed.<br>
            The output file(s) will have the same name as the input file, but with the addition "_converted".
            <br><br>Please select the CSV file(s) you wish to convert.
