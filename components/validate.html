            Extracted files may contain signals which have artifacts. By using this tool you will be able to omit signals which contain artifacts
            . Validation screens will be created, these can be used by the user to exclude artifact data in the combined EEG, TES MEP data.
            This results in a new file which does not contain the omitted signals. The output file will have the same name as the input file,
            but with the addition "_VALIDATED"
            <br><br>Please select an extracted you wish to validate.
