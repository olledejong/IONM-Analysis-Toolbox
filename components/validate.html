        <h3 class="content-h">Validate an extracted file by excluding artifact data</h3>
        <p class="content-p">
            Extracted files may contain signals which have artifacts. By using this tool, you will be able to omit signals which contain artifacts.
            Validation screens will be created, these can be used by the user to exclude artifact data in the combined EEG and TRG data.
            This results in a new file which does not contain the omitted signals. The output file will have the same name as the input file,
            but with the addition "_VALIDATED".
            <br><br>Please select an extracted file you wish to validate.
